# Elastic Compute Cloud

## TLDR
EC2 is a the combination of a virtual machine and hardware capacity attached to that vm in AWS. It is one of the oldest services and well integrated into most other services.

## Virtual Machines (EC2)

### Configuration Options
- OS (Win, Linux, MacOs)
- CPU
- RAM
- Network attached storage ([[EBS]] & [[EFS]])
- Hardware attached ([[InstanceStore]])
- Network Card (Speed, Ip)
- Firewall ([[SecurityGroup]])
- Bootstrap script (User Data)

### User Data
- Is a script is run once on the first start of the instance
- Script is run using root privileges

### Use Cases
- Installing updates
- Installing software
- Download files from the internet

### Instance Types

#### Type Definition
- Split by family
- In family types are defined by Class.Generation.Size 

#### Families

##### General Purpose
- Balance between, computing, memory and network speed

##### Compute Optimized
- High cpu power

###### Use Cases
- Ml
- Media Transcoding 
-  ...

##### Memory Optimized
- High amount of RAM/Memory

###### Use Cases
- Process large data sets in memory
- Non relational databases
- Cache stores
- In memory databases 
- Real time processing of big unstructured data

##### Storage Optimized
- High amount of Disk IOPs

###### Use Cases
- A lot of Datasets in local storage
- High frequency online transaction processing systems
- Databases
- Cache for in mem databases (e.g. redis)
- Distributed file systems
- Data warehouse applications

## Purchasing Options

### On Demand
- Price by second
- Use for short workload

### Reserved

#### Default
- 1 Year OR 3 Years 
- Cheaper than on demand
- Need to specify type os, region, tenancy
- Cheaper if payed upfront
- Scope reserve in zone and AZ
- You can sell peer to peer in marketplace

#### Convertible
- More expensive than default
- Can change instance type, os, region, tenancy

### [[SavingsPlans]]
- 1 Year OR 3 Years
- Up to same discount as default reserved instance
- Commit to an amount of usage (cpu, mem, disk)
- Beyond commit is billed on demand price
- Locked to instance family and region
- Can change os, tenancy, and instance size

### Spot Instances
- Cheapest
- Can lose instance
- Define max price you are willing to pay, if you are overbid your instance is gone

#### Use Cases
- Short workloads
- Suited for resilient jobs
- Distributed workloads (these are resilient by definition)
- batch jobs

### Dedicated Hosts
- Rent an entire physical server, control placement of that server
- can use on demand or reserved 
- most expensive 
- can convert to dedicated instance

#### Use Cases
- Compliance
- Server bound software licenses

### Dedicated Instances
- No other customer will share the hardware used by you
- Hardware may be shared within same account
- No control over instance placement (hardware might be moved)
- can convert to dedicated host

### Capacity Reservations
- Reserve a capacity in a AZ for duration (on demand instance)
- No time commitment
- No billing discount
- Combine with Saving plan and Reserved Instances for same AZ to save money
- Charged on demand price if instance is not running

  #### Use Cases
- short term uninterrupted workload in a specific az

## Spot Instance
- Request for an instance and the instance running itself is different
- If you terminate your instance but not the request the instance will be relaunched
- If you cancel your request your instance will still be running
![[Pasted image 20221101164159.png]]
### Spot Blocks
- Duration window of your Spot instance 
- 1 to 6 hours
- designed to not be interrupted

### Fleet
- Define multiple options for instance type , region etc
- Define a budget and target capacity

#### Strategies
- Lowest price, launch from lowest price pool
- Diversified, launch from all pools (resilience)
- Capacity optimized, launch from pool with strongest capacity settings

## Elastic Ip
- A static ip which can be attached to Elastic Network Interfaces and other services
- Used to mask a fail by keeping ip but changing machine
- Up to 5 per account
- Can request more than 5 from aws

## Placement Groups
Placement strategy for a group ec2 instances

### Spread
- Multi AZ 
- Different hardware
- Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group
- Use for critical apps and high availability

### Cluster
- Same rack
- Fast internal connection from ec2 to ec2 
- Used for low latency and big data jobs with deadline
- Rack fail -> all EC2s fail

### Partition
- Multi AZ
- Multi rack but same rack per partition

#### Use Case
-  big data application which are partition aware

## ENI Elastic Network Interfaces
- Virtual Network Card
- Can be used not only for ec2
- Eth0 = primary ENI
- Primary private ip
- Can add multiple for multiple private ips
- Can attach elastic ip
- Can attach mac address
- Can attach and detach from instance
- Bound by AZ
### EFA Elastic Fabric Adapter
- use to accelerate high performance computing by providing os bypass hardware interface
- cannot be used for windows 

### ENA Elastic Network Adapter
- use for high performance networking capabilities
- slower than efa

## EC2 Hibernate
- Standby for EC2, ram is saved
- Faster startup
- Root [[EBS]] must be encrypted
- Used for breaks in very long running tasks or if an instances takes very long to startup
- Can last no longer than 60 days
- Must be enabled before launch

## EC2 Instance Recover
- Creates a new EC2 instance which is identical to the previous ec2
- recovers private and public ip, metadata, elastic ip, instance id
- data in memory is lost

## Limits
- by default your account has a maximum limit for ec2 instances based on the total vCPU used, you can submit a request to increase that limit
