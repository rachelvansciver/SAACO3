# Amazon S3

- object based storage
- max storage 5 TB
- if uploading more than 5gb use multi upload
- also has metadata, tags and optional version id
- read after write consistency
- 3,5k writes and 5k puts per second



## Requester Pays
- Requester pays network and download cost
- use to share large data sets with other accounts
- user must be authorized in aws 
- owned by aws account, must specify permissions for other accounts

## S3 event notifications
- trigger an action (lambda) on api request to the bucket
- can also use event bridge for more targets and filters

### Targets
- [[Lambda]]
- [[SNS]] 
- [[SQS]]
- can take more than 1 min to trigger

## S3 Access Logs
- monitor traffic requests to an S3 bucket
- can be used for access and security audits
- understand s3 bill

## MFA-protected API Access
- enforce MFA for access to S3 resources

## MFA delete
- enforce MFA for delete object action

## Versioning
- if an object is updated the old version still persists within the bucket
- if an object is deleted the new version will be a delete marker, and the old version will still persist within the bucket

## Commands 


### S3 Sync
- copies objects between buckets
- does diff
- used last modified to update
- if versioned only copies current version
```bash
aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET
```

## Storage Tiers
- can transition to infrequent access only after 30 days

### Glacier
- some applications can save data directly into Glacier (e.g. Tape gateway, data sync) , you can also do this manually by using cli
- snowball transfer cannot be directly inserted only transferred from default tier
- low cost but higher retrieval cost and time
- retrieve within 12 hours

#### Expedited Retrieval
- 1 to 5 minutes of retrieval time 

#### Provisioned Retrieval Capacity
- guaranteed up to 150mbs retrieval speed

#### Glacier Deep Archive
- 75% cheaper than Glacier
- higher retrieval feed than glacier
- no expedited retrieval
- can retrieve at lower fee using bulk retrieve but this will take 48 hours

### Infrequent Access
- less freq access, but instantly available
- low per GB Storage price
- retrieval fee

### One Zone / One Zone IA
- single AZ storage 20% less cost

## Lifecycle Rules

### Transition Actions
- move to different storage tier over time
- can transition to infrequent access after 30 days

### Transfer Limitations for Lifecycle Rules
![[Pasted image 20221101123650.png]]

### Expiration Actions
- delete access logs
- delete old versions of files
- delete incomplete multi part uploads
- can apply to paths or full bucket

## Transfer Accelerator
- fast transfer over long distances
- uses cloudfront edge locations
- routes via optimized path

## Multipart uploads
- transmit object in chunks
- if one chunk fails, only that chunk needs to be retransmitted
- over 100mb should be considered
-  improved throughput

## S3 Bucket Policies
- add or deny permissions to objects
- can be attached to users groups or buckets
- can grant access to other aws accounts
- can restrict based on multi conditions for the requests (ip, time, ssl )

## ACL
- can also use ACL to grant another account access

## Encryption

### SEE S3
- Server Side encryption of objects 
- aws managed
- replication by default

### SSE
- Server Side encryption
- customer managed keys
- objects can not be replicated

### SSE KMS
- Need to specify need key for object in new bucket
- need iam role to decrypt with source key and encrypt with new key
- might get [[KMS]] throttling errors, need to ask for service quotas increase
- can use multi region kms keys 

### Client Side Encryption
- Encrypt before upload and decrypt after download using own mechanism

## Replication
- must have versioning in both buckets
- can be cross region or same region
- can be bucket in other account
- async
- use batch replication to replicate existing ones
- cant chain replication

### Use cases
- compliance
- latency
- replication across accounts
- log aggregation
- sync data to test account from prod

## Performance
- 100-200ms
- 3,5k put copy post delete per prefix
- 5,5k read per prefix
- use multi part upload for parallel upload
- transfer accel to upload to edge location instead of directly to s3, also use for dl if files are bigger than 1GB
- byte range fetches -> multi part download

## Select
- filter data server side to reduce network cost (100 lines out of 1 mil lines csv)

## Batch operations
- modify all metadata and properties
- copy objects between buckets
- encrypt all unencrypted objects
- modify acl and tags
- restore objects from glacier
- invoke lambda for each object
- use s3 select to filter then batch

## Vault
- Objects can not be modified or deleted
- used for compliance
- Can lock the vault policy from future edits

## Server Access Logging
- If [[CloudTrail]] is not enough information you use this

### Features
- including referrer
- including turn around time
